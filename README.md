# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification (CNN)

This project explores tomato leaf disease classification using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the PlantVillage dataset.

## Current Stage
- Dataset exploration
- CNN trained from scratch (baseline)
- Notebook-first workflow

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook
- uv for environment management

## Dataset
PlantVillage (Tomato – 10 classes)  
Dataset is not included due to size.

## Next Steps
- Training analysis
- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning (ResNet)
- Detection (YOLO)
